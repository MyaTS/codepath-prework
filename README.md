**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Mya Thanegi Soe**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://mature-yielding-mercury.glitch.me/)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [X] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Video Walkthrough (GIF)

If you recorded multiple GIFs for all the implemented features, you can add them here:
I was going to upload the whole game but it says the file size has to be less than 10MB to be able to upload, so I will just be uploading a small snippet.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
Stackoverflow, w3schools, Googling

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The javascript implementation was the most challenging for me although I wasn't new to it. 
Honestly, I'm not really proficient with javascript, so when trying to code a random pattern for the music, I was confused. It would be simple for me with python so I had to google a bit. 
The other thing that I'm really not sure how and wish I had a bit more time to work on is being able to add anime music to the buttons instead of using the original frequency. I can import the audio and all but to really divide up the music and make the music flow through the chorus was a challenge I didn't have time for currently, as I'm in a rush to submit. 
First, I would have to get rid of all the frequencies, and because the pattern will start at a random button, I can't assign fixed music tones from the song anymore. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I do have a lot of questions regarding how I can better my user interface and enhance user experience through the game. 
There are a lot of libraries and frameworks, that sometimes I don't know which ones are the one I actually want and want to learn how to use. 
I guess the only way to find out is through more experimentation, watching more tutorials or read more documentations. 
I do have questions on how people actually make aesthetically pleasing website desgins, but that would lean more towards graphics.
I would like to work with more advanced applications after this. I have some previous experience with front-end so I would like to gain experience with back-end. I want to collaborate with others on a huge project! 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would definitely add music to the game, instead of having the current tones, I would add anime music to the buttons. Overall, the memory game will be playing the chorus part of the song instead of the current frequencies. 
I would also like to create a drop-down bar where the user can choose the difficulty level of the game. If it's easy, I will keep everything the same, if it's medium I will expand it to a 4x4 matrix for buttons, and speed up the sequence. If it's hard, I will make it a 5x5 matrix for the buttons, and will make the pattern longer as well. 
I think the designs of the buttons can be improved and the overall look of the website as well.
